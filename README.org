** Requests

- Could Henrik discuss the upcoming rewrite?

* When is it?

To be determined.

* Meeting Platform

** Candidates

*** Gathertown

https://gather.town/

*** Calla

https://github.com/capnmidnight/Calla

* Schedule

August maybe?

** Timezone

Lets gather people's timezones and GMT Offsets to try and find a common time
that covers the most amount of people. This site can help find the offset:

Maybe we can create a formula to calculate how a specific time within a base
timezone aligns with all users?


No one has to specify all information here. User and GMT offset should be enough.

| User        | Location             | Timezone | GMT Offset                  |   |
|-------------+----------------------+----------+-----------------------------+---|
| eccentric-j | NY, USA              | EST      | -5                          |   |
| raf         | Melbourne, Australia | AEDT     | +11 or +10 (depends on DST) |   |


* Is this serious?

Pretty sure. It's not outside of the realm of realistic possibilities to pull
this off but there are certainly some big unknowns and moving parts.
